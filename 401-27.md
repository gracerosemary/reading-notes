## Django Models
Models define the structure of stored data (ex. field types, default values, election list options, etc.). To use a database, you only need to write the model structure and Django will handle the db communication. 

### Designing models
Think about the relationship-entity for the information that needs to be stored. Create separate models for every object (group of related information). You can also use models to represent selection-list options (ex. drop down list), which is better for options that can change in the future. 

LocalLibrary example:
objects: books, book instances, authors, book genre, language

Django allows 3 relationships:
- one to one (OneToOneField)
- one to many (ForeignKey)
- many to many (ManyToManyField)

models:
- Book: generic details of the book
- BookInstance: status of specific copies available in the system 
- Author: name, DOB, DOD, associated books
- Genre: for creating/selecting values through admin interface

### Model primer
Models are defined in the apps `models.py` file and are implemented as subclasses of `django.db.models.Model`. 

```
from django.db import models

class MyModelName(models.Model):
  """A typical class defining a model, derived from the Model class."""
  pass
```

#### Fields
Models can have any number of fields (of any type). Each field represents a column of data that needs to be stored in a database table. Each database record (row) consists of one of each field value.

```
example_field = models.CharField(max_length=20, help_text='Enter field doc')
```
field = example_field  
type = models.CharField (field only contains strings of alphanumeric characters)   
arg (max_length) = max length of a value in the field  
arg (help_text) = text label that is displayed to the user  

*Use argument `verbose_name` (default is None), which replaces and underscores in the field name with a space (`example_field` = example field)

#### Metadata
Declare model-level metadata for the Model:
```
class Meta:
  ordering = ['-example_field']
```
You can control the default ordering of records returned when you query the model type. Specify the match order in a list of field names to the `ordering` attribute. Depending on the type of field, the ordering will differ (characters are sorted alphabetically, dates are chronological, etc.). To reverse the sorting order, prefix the field name with a minus symbol (in the example above). 

```
ordering = ['title', '-pubdate']
```
- Books would be sorted alphabetically by title (A-Z) and then by publication date inside each title (from newest to oldest). 

View full list of metadata options: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/models/options/  

#### Methods
Every model should have a dunder str method, so that it returns a human-readable string for each object. The string represents individual records in the admin site. 
```
def __str__(self):
  return self.field_name
```

Using `get_absolute_url()` returns a URL for displaying individual model records on the website (Django will automatically add a 'View on Site' button in the Admin site). 
```
def get_absolute_url(self):
  """Returns the url to access a particular instance of the model."""
  return reverse('model-detail-view', args=[str(self.id)])
```

#### Model management
Create, update, delete records. Run queries to get all records or subsets. 
```
# create a new record with a constructor
record = MyModelName(example_field='Instance #1')

# save to db
record.save()
```

#### Searching for records
Search for records that match certain criteria using the model's `objects` attribute, which is provided by the base class.

model: Book  
fields: title, genre  

model: genre  
field: name  

Get all records for a model as a `QuerySet` (iterable obhect) using `objects.all()`. 

```
all_books = Book.objects.all()
```

Use `filter()` to filter the returned `QuerySet` to match a specified text or numeric field. 
Example: filter for books that have 'wild' in the tile and count them:
```
wild_books = Book.objects.filter(title__contains='wild')
number_wild_books = wild_books.count()
```

### Re-run the database migrations
Once all the models have been created, re-run the db migrations to add them to the db:
```
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```
____
## Django admin site
Django admin application uses the models to automatially build an admin site where you can create, view, update, and delete records. It helps manage data in production, depending on the type of site. To add the models to the admin application, they need to be registered.

### Registering models
Register models in the `admin.py` file and import models using `admin.site.register(modelName)`.
`admin.py`:
```
from django.contrib import admin

from .models import Author, Genre

admin.site.register(Book)
admin.site.register(Author)
```

### Creating a superuser
Create an admin account within `manage.py`:  
`$ python3 manage.py createsuperuser`  
| enter username, email address, and strong password  
`$ python3 manage.py runserver`  
| test login  

### Logging in and using the site
Open from the /admin URL (http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin) and enter credentials on the login page. 

The admin site displays all the models, grouped by installed apps. Each model can be clicked to go to another screen that lists all the assocaited records. Click on the records to edit them. Click `Add` to create a record. 

### Advanced configuration
- Individual records (identified in the dunder str methods) are linked to detail views/forms for editing. The view has an action menu at the top, which can be used to bulk delete records.
- Record forms for editing/adding records contain all the fields in the model.
- You can customize the interface with list and detail views.
