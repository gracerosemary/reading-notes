Go in prepared and with a humble attitute!
1. Restate the question in your own words and seek affirmation
2. Ask and identify edge cases
3. Ask about test cases (are there any test cases a function should pass?)
4. Write steps of the solution & pseudo code and ask if it makes sense
5. Write actual code and ask if it looks good
6. Ask for help and don't sweat the small stuff

If you have extra time at the end, review your work and its efficiency.
