# Pythonism

## Dunder Methods
Special methods are predefined methos that enrich classes. They start and end with double underscores.

Dunder/Special methods emulate behavior of built-in types. The Python data model lets you use features like sequences, iteration, operation overloading, attribute access, etc.

### Object Initialization: `__init__`
Acts as a constructor that sets up the object. 

### Object Representation: `__str__`, `__repr__`
repr: the official string rep of the object (not ambiguous)
str: informal or nicely printable string representation of an object (only for enduser)

### Iteration: `__len__`, `__getitem__`, `__reversed__`
```
class Account:
    def add_transaction(self, amount):
        if not isinstance(amount, int):
            raise ValueError('please use int for amount')
        self._transactions.append(amount)
        
    @property
    def balance(self):
        return self.amount + sum(self._transactions)

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self._transactions)

    def __getitem__(self, position):
        return self._transactions[position]
        
    def __reversed__(self):
        return self[::-1]
```

### Operator Overloading for Comparing Accounts: `__eq__`, `__lt__`
```
from functools import total_ordering

@total_ordering
class Account:
    # ... (see above)

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.balance == other.balance

    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.balance < other.balance
```

### Operator Overloading for Merging Accounts: `__add__`
```
def __add__(self, other):
    owner = self.owner + other.owner
    start_amount = self.balance + other.balance
    return Account(owner, start_amount)
```

### Callable Python Objects: `__call__`
```
class Account:
    # ... (see above)

    def __call__(self):
        print('Start amount: {}'.format(self.amount))
        print('Transactions: ')
        for transaction in self:
            print(transaction)
        print('\nBalance: {}'.format(self.balance))
```

### Context Manager Support and the `with` statement: `__enter__`, `__exit__`
Context Manager: simple protool/interface that object needs to follow so it can be used with the `with` statement. Add enter & exit methods to an object if you want it to function as a context manager. 
```
class Account:
    # ... (see above)

    def __enter__(self):
        print('ENTER WITH: Making backup of transactions for rollback')
        self._copy_transactions = list(self._transactions)
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        print('EXIT WITH:', end=' ')
        if exc_type:
            self._transactions = self._copy_transactions
            print('Rolling back to previous transactions')
            print('Transaction resulted in {} ({})'.format(
                exc_type.__name__, exc_val))
        else:
            print('Transaction OK')
    
    def validate_transaction(acc, amount_to_add):
        with acc as a:
            print('Adding {} to account'.format(amount_to_add))
            a.add_transaction(amount_to_add)
            print('New balance would be: {}'.format(a.balance))
            if a.balance < 0:
                raise ValueError('sorry cannot go in debt!')
```

## Python Iterators
Objects that support `__iter__` and `__next__` methods automatically work with for-in loops. 

Infinity Loop Implementation:
```
class Repeater:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __iter__(self):
        return RepeaterIterator(self)
        
# helper class to help the for-in iteration work        
class RepeaterIterator:
    # link each RepeaterIterator instance to the Repeater object that created it - hold onto the "source" object being iterated over
    def __init__(self, source):
        self.source = source

    # reach back into the "source" instance and return the value associated with it
    def __next__(self):
        return self.source.value
```

Simple Iterator Class:
```
class Repeater:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        return self.value
```

Bounded Repeater (stops after predefined number of reps):
```
class BoundedRepeater:
    def __init__(self, value, max_repeats):
        self.value = value
        self.max_repeats = max_repeats
        self.count = 0

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.count >= self.max_repeats:
            raise StopIteration
        self.count += 1
        return self.value
```

## Python Generators
Syntactic sugar for writing objects that support the iterator protocol. 

Generators turn this:
```
class Repeater:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        return self.value
```
into:
```
def repeater(value):
    while True:
        yield value
```

Calling a generator function doesn't run the function. It creates and returns a generator object. The function only executes when `next()` is called on the generator object. 
```
>>> generator_obj = repeater('Hey')
>>> next(generator_obj)
'Hey'
```

> Whereas a return statement disposes of a functionâ€™s local state, a yield statement suspends the function and retains its local state.
- local variables and the execution state of the generator function are only stashed temporarily and not thrown out completely

Generators stop generating values as soon as control flow returns from the generator function by any means other than a yeild statement. 

```
def repeat_three_times(value):
    yield value
    yield value
    yield value
    
>>> for x in repeat_three_times('Hey there'):
...     print(x)
'Hey there'
'Hey there'
'Hey there'
```
^Generator stops producing values after 3 iterations. They raise the StopIteration exceptions (under the hood).
