# Trees
## Common Terminology
Node: individual item/data that makes up the data structure  
Root: the first/top Node in the tree  
Left Child: node that is positioned to the left of a root or node  
Right Child: node that is positioned to the right of a root or node  
Edge: the link between a parent and child node  
Leaf: node that does not contain any children  
Height: determined by the number of edges from the root to the bottommost node  

## Traversals
### Depth First 
Prioritizes going through the depth (height) of the tree first.   
Pre-order: root >> left >> right   
In-order: left >> root >> right  
Post-order: left >> right >> root  

Traversal most commonly done using recursion. Relies on the call stack to navigate back up the tree when we reach the end of a subpath.   

#### Pre-order
```
ALGORITHM preOrder(root)
// INPUT <-- root node
// OUTPUT <-- pre-order output of tree node's values

    OUTPUT <-- root.value

    if root.left is not Null
        preOrder(root.left)

    if root.right is not NULL
        preOrder(root.right)
```
1. root is added to the call stack
2. check if root has a left node set
3. if yes, send the left node to preOrder recursively (left node is the new root)
4. repeat until leaf node is reached
5. leaf node is popped off the stack and root is reassigned to parent node (when function call is completed, we pop it off the stack and continue execution through previous funtion call)

#### In-order
```
ALGORITHM inOrder(root)
// INPUT <-- root node
// OUTPUT <-- in-order output of tree node's values

    if root.left is not NULL
        inOrder(root.left)

    OUTPUT <-- root.value

    if root.right is not NULL
        inOrder(root.right)
```

#### Post-order
```
ALGORITHM postOrder(root)
// INPUT <-- root node
// OUTPUT <-- post-order output of tree node's values

    if root.left is not NULL
        postOrder(root.left)

    if root.right is not NULL
        postOrder(root.right)

    OUTPUT <-- root.value
```

### Breadth First
Iterates through the tree by going your each level (like rows), node-by-node. Uses a queue to traverse the width/breadth of the tree. 
1. pull root into the queue
2. dequeue it and use that node in our code
3. enqueue the left and right child
4. dequeue th front node, enqueue the node's left and right nodes and move to the next new front of the queue
5. repeat dequeue + enqueue children process
```
ALGORITHM breadthFirst(root)
// INPUT  <-- root node
// OUTPUT <-- front node of queue to console

  Queue breadth <-- new Queue()
  breadth.enqueue(root)

  while breadth.peek()
    node front = breadth.dequeue()
    OUTPUT <-- front.value

    if front.left is not NULL
      breadth.enqueue(front.left)

    if front.right is not NULL
      breadth.enqueue(front.right)
```

## Binary Trees
Restricts number of children to two (left and right). Nodes can be added wherever space allows (no sorting order). 

### Adding a node
- fill all "child" spots from top down (breadth first traversal - find the first node that does not have 2 child nodes and insert the new node as a child, from left to right)
- reference both the new node to create and the parent node

### Big O
Adding a new node - O(n)  
Searching for a specific node - O(n)  
Worst case scenario involves traversing the entire tree (if the tree has 'n' nodes, then we have to potentially look at 'n' items)  

Node insertion (breadth first) - O(w)  
'w' is the largest width of the tree   

Height - log n (n is the number of nodes)  

## Binary Search Trees
Does have structure, as the nodes are organized with the root having smaller values on the left and larger values on the right. 

### Searching a BST
- compare the node you are searching for against the root of the tree or sub-tree. If the value is smaller, traverse the left. If the value is larger, traverse the right.
- use a while loop to cycle through until we hit a leaf or until we reach a match. 

Big O time is O(h) - h for height. Space is O(1) since we are not allocating any additional space.
