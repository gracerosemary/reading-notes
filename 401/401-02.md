## [In Tests We Trust — TDD with Python](https://code.likeagirl.io/in-tests-we-trust-tdd-with-python-af69f47e6932)  
Author: Ana Paula Gomes

Unit tests are codes to exercise the input, output, and code behavior.
Test-Driven Development is a strategy to think/write tests first.

### Think with baby steps

Test name needs to be descriptive and state what is expected and what we are testing.
Example: def test_should_return_female_when_the_name_is_from_female_gender():
> should return female when the name is from a female

Test file name should follow the same name of the module name.

```
mymodule/
— module.py
— another_folder/
— — another_module.py
tests/
— test_module.py
— another_folder/
— — test_another_module.py
```
 
Structure should follow AAA: 
Arrange - organize data needed for input 
Act: execute the code being tested (behavior)
Assert: check if the result (ouput) is expected

Library suggestion for testing: `pytest`
 
### The Cycle
1. Write a unit test and make it fail
2. Write the feature and make it pass
3. Refactor code

### Summary
- Craft the software design first
- Code is more reliable and can be tested after a change
- Practice!

## [Recursion](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recursion/)  
> The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily.

### Base Condition
The solution to the base case is provided in recursive programming. 
The solution of the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems.

```
int fact(int n)
{
    if (n < = 1) // base case
        return 1;
    else    
        return n*fact(n-1);    
}
```

The base case for n <= 1 is defined. The larger value can be solved by converting to smaller one til base case is reached.

### Stack Overflow Error
Can occur if the base case is not reached or defined. 
Example: If fact(10) is called, it will call fact(9), fact(8), fact(7) and so on but the number will never reach 100. So, the base case is not reached. If the memory is exhausted by these functions on the stack, it will cause a stack overflow error. 

### Direct and Indirect Recursion
Direct recursion calls the same function. 
Indirect recursion calls another function, that calls the original function. 

### Tailed and non-tailed recursion
A recursive function is tail recursive when recursive call is the LAST thing executed by the function. (hence tail)

### Memory allocation for recursion
The memory for a called function is allocated on top of memory allocated to calling function and different copy of local variables is created for each of the function calls. Once base case is reached, function returns its value to the function and memory is then de-allocated (repeat the process). 

### Disadvantages of recursive programming over iterative programming?
Recursive programming has greate space requirements, since all functions will remain in the stack until the base case is reached. Also has greater time requirements because of functions calls and returns overhead.

### Advantages of recursive programming over iterative programming?
Cleaner and simpler way of writing code. Tree traversals and some other problems are inherently recursive.
