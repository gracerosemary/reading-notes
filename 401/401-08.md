# Game of Greed 3 - List Comprehension

### List Comprehensions
- consists of brackets with an expression, for clause, then 0 or more for or if clauses. Results in a new list from evaluating the expression in the context of the for and if clauses. 
- use of brackets reminds us that the result is always a list.

Syntax:
```
[ expression for item in list if conditional ]
```

Before:
```
new_list = []
for i in old_list:
    if filter(i):
        new_list.append(expressions(i))
```
After:
```
new_list = [expression(i) for i in old_list if filter(i)]
```

#### List Comprehensions in functions
Use list comprehension on a function:
```
def double(x):
  return x*2
  
>>> [double(x) for x in range(10)]

>>> [double(x) for x in range(10) if x%2==0]

>>> [x+y for x in [10,30,50] for y in [20,40,60]]
```
