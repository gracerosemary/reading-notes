# The global statement
- Define a list of names that are going to be treated as global names. 
- Consists of the `global` keyword, followed by one or more names separated by commas. 
- Can use multiple global statements with a name (or a list of names). 
```
>>> counter = 0  # A global name
>>> def update_counter():
...     global counter  # Declare counter as global
...     counter = counter + 1  # Successfully update the counter
...
>>> update_counter()
>>> counter
1
>>> update_counter()
>>> counter
2
>>> update_counter()
>>> counter
3
```
- The use of `global` is bad practice if there's a better solution to the problem (ex. trying to write self-contained function that relies on local names rather than global names).
- You can use `global` from inside any function or nested function and the names listed will always be mapped to names in the global scope. 

# The nonlocal statement
- Can be accessed from inner function, but not assigned or updated. 
- To modify nonlocal names, you need to use a `nonlocal` statement, which allows you to define a list of names that are going to be treated as nonlocal. 
- Consists of the `nonlocal` keyword followed by one or more names separated by commas. 
- Names refer to the same names in the enclosing scope.
```
>>> def func():
...     var = 100  # A nonlocal variable
...     def nested():
...         nonlocal var  # Declare var as nonlocal
...         var += 100
...
...     nested()
...     print(var)
...
>>> func()
200
```
- Unlike global, you cannot use `nonlocal` outside of a nested or enclosed function (ex. local/global scope).
- Names must already exist in the enclosing scope if you want to use it as a nonlocal name. 

# Scopes
LEGB: Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in

In scope: can access the value of given name from someplace in the code
Out of scope: can't access the name

scope: determines where in your program a name is visible and implemented as dictionaries that map names to objects 
namespace: the dictionary -> mechanisms used to store names (stored under __dict__ attribute)

# Big O Video
- Breaks down expected Algorithm performance based on data size
- Based on worst case scenario

O(1): constant
O(log n): logarithmic
O(n): linear (based on number of inputs)
O(n logn): log-linear
O(n**k): polynomial
O(c**n): exponential

## Binary Search
O(log n)

- list in ascending order and contains unique values
- havles the length of the list x repeat
- growth curve peaks at the beginning and slowly flattens out as the size of the data sets increase
