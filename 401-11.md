Data analysis package that speeds up workflow and interface with other packages. 

SSV: semicolon separated values (7.4;0.7;5)
Each record is separated by a semicolon and rows are separated by a new line. 

### Lists of Lists for CSV data
- import `csv` library
- open file and create a new csv.reader object
- call the list type to get all the rows from the file and assign it to `wines`
  ```
  with open('winequality-red.csv', r) as f:
    wines = list(csv.reader(f, delimiter=';'))
  ```
- print out the first 3 rows
  ```
  print(wines[:3])
  # output
  [['fixed acidity', 'volatile acidity', 'citric acid', 'residual sugar', 'chlorides', 'free sulfur dioxide', 'total sulfur dioxide', 'density', 'pH', 'sulphates', 'alcohol', 'quality'], ['7.4', '0.7', '0', '1.9', '0.076', '11', '34', '0.9978', '3.51', '0.56', '9.4', '5'], ['7.8', '0.88', '0', '2.6', '0.098', '25', '67', '0.9968', '3.2', '0.68', '9.8', '5']]
  ```
- each inner list is a row from the ssv file
- each item in the entire list of lists is a string
- first row contains column headders

To get the average quality (last column):
1. extract last element from each row (after the header row)
2. convert each element to a float
3. assign to list "qualities"
4. divide the sum of all elements by total number of elements (mean/average)

```
qualities =
[float(item[-1]) for item in wines[1:]]
sum(qualities) / len(qualities)
# output
5.6360225
```
[1:] - slicing fetches section starting at index 1
[-1] - count from the right

### Numpy 2-Dimensional Arrays
2-dimensional arrays - also called matrix.
Extract an element by specifying row and column number.

rank: the number of dimensions
axis: each dimension
- the rows are the first axis, and the columns are the second axis

#### Create a NumPy Array
- Use the `numpy.array` function
- Pass in a lists of lists, which will create a NumPy array with the same number of rows and columns
- Leave off the header (strings) to get all the other elements to be float (all elements have to be the same data type)

1. Import `numpy` package
2. Pass the list of lists into the array function
3. Exclude the header with list slicing
4. Specify the `dtype` to convert to float
```
import csv
with open("winequality-red.csv", 'r') as f:
  wines = list(csv.reader(f, delimiter=";"))
import numpy as np
wines = np.array(wines[1:], dtype=np.float)
```
5. Check the number of rows and columns using `shape`
```
wines.shape
# output
(1599, 12)
```

#### Alternate Creation Methods
numpy.zeros:
`empty_array = np.zeros((3,4)) empty_array`: create an array with 3 rows, 4 columns, with every element being `0`

np.random.rand:
`np.random.rand(3,4)`: create an array where each element is a random number 

#### Read In Files
numpy.genfromtxt: read in our initial data
1. use `genfromtxt` function to read file
2. delimiter parses fields properly
3. skip header row
```
wines = np.genfromtxt("winequality-red.csv", delimiter=";", skip_header=1)
```

#### Indexing NumPy Arrays
- NumPy is zero-indexed (starts count at 0)
- `wines[2,3]` selects the element at row 3 and column 4
- 2-dimentional arrays need 2 indexes to retrieve an element

#### Slicing NumPy Arrays
- Use a colon (:), which selects all the elements from the starting index up to but not including the ending index (slicing)
- `wines[0:3,3]` selects the first 3 items from the 4th column (omitting the 0 does the same thing)
- `wines[:,3]` selects the entire 4th column
- `wines[3,:]` selects an entire row
- `wines[:,:` selects the entire array

#### Assigning values to arrays
- assign it a value
- `wines[:,10] = 50` overwrites all the values in the 11th column with 50

### 1-Dimensional NumPy Arrays
Also known as a vector. Only needs a single index to retrieve an element. 

### N-Dimensional NumPy Arrays
Index and slice, passing in an extra axis  
`earnings[:,0,0]`: earnings of first element from all years  
`earnings[:,0,:]`: first quarter earnings from all years  

#### Converting data types
- numpy.ndarray.astype: converts array to different type by copying - the array and returning a new array with the specified data type
- `wines.astype(int)`: converts wines to the `int` data type
- Check the name property to see new data type:
  ```
  int_wines = wines.astype(int)
  int_wines.dtype.name
  ```
  
### NumPy Array Operations
operators: /, *, -, +, ^
`wines[:,11] + 10`: adds 10 points to each quality score and returns a new array

Modifies the original array:
```
wines[:,11] += 10
wines[:,11] + 10
```
`wines[:,11] + wines[:,11]`: adds the column to itself (equivalent to wines[11] * 2)

#### Broadcasting
If number of elements are not the same in the arrays, broadcasting takes place:
1. last dimensional of each array is compared
2. if lengths of dimensions match up or if one of the dimensions is a length of 1, we keep going
3. if lengths aren't equal and none of the dimensions have length 1, an error occurs (`ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (1599,12) (2,)</module></ipython>`)
4. continue checking dimensions until the shortest array is out of dimensions

A: (50,50)
B: (49,49)
- these two arrays do not match because the lengths aren't equal and neither array has dimension length equal to 1

### NumPy Array Methods
`numpy.ndarray.sum`: finds the sum of all the elements in an array:
```
wines[:,11].sum()
```
Pass in the axis to find the sums over the first axis of the array:
```
wines.sum(axis=0)
```
Check the shape (size) to verify sum:
```
wines.sum(axis=0).shape
```
`numpy.ndarray.mean` — finds the mean of an array.  
`numpy.ndarray.std` — finds the standard deviation of an array.  
`numpy.ndarray.min` — finds the minimum value in an array.  
`numpy.ndarray.max` — finds the maximum value in an array.  

### NumPy Array Comparisons
Test to see if rows match certain values using math comparison operators (<, >, etc.).   
`wines[:,11] > 5`: wines with quality rating of higher than 5 (returns boolean)  

Subsetting - select certain rows/columns
Select rows where quality is over 7:
```
high_quality = wines[:,11] > 7
wines[high_quality,:][:3,:]
```

### Reshaping NumPy Arrays
Change the shape while preserving all the elements, which makes it easier to access elements. 

`numpy.transpose`: flips the axes (rows become columns, etc.)
```
np.transpose(wines).shape
```
`numpy.ravel`: turn array into a 1-dim representation (flatten an array)
```
wines.ravel()
```
`numpy.reshape`: reshape an array to a certain shape we specify
Turn 2nd row of wines into a 2-dim array with 2 rows & 6 columns:
```
wines[1,:].reshape((2,6))
```

#### Combining NumPy Arrays
`numpy.vstack`: vertically stack multiple arrays (adding new rows to one array)  
`numpy.hstack`: combine arrays horizontally (number of rows stay constant and columns are joined) - needs same numbers of rows to work  
`numpy.concatenate`: general purpose version of hstack and vstack. Specify the axis that we want to concatenate along. Concatenating first axis - vstack, second axis - hstack.  
```
white_wines = np.genfromtxt("winequality-white.csv", delimiter=";", skip_header=1)
white_wines.shape
all_wines = np.vstack((wines, white_wines))
np.concatenate((wines, white_wines), axis=0)
```
