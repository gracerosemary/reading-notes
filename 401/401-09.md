# Game of Greed 4 - Dunder Methods & Probability

## Dunder Methods
- predefined methods
- short for "double under"
- lets you emulate behavior of built-in types

## Python Data model
- Object Initialization: `__init__`
  - allows construction of objects
- Object Representation: `__str__`, `__repr__`
  - str: informal / nicely printable string representation of an object (for the enduser)
  - repr: official string representation of an object. goal is to be unambiguous
- Iteration: `__len__`, `__getitem__`, `__reversed__`
  - ```
    class Account:
    # ... (see above)

      def __len__(self):
          return len(self._transactions)
  
      def __getitem__(self, position):
          return self._transactions[position]
      def __reversed__(self):
          return self[::-1]
    
- Operator Overloading for Comparing Accounts: `__eq__`, `__lt__`
  - ```
    from functools import total_ordering
    @total_ordering
    class Account:
        # ... (see above)
    
        def __eq__(self, other):
            return self.balance == other.balance

        def __lt__(self, other):
            return self.balance < other.balance
- Operator Overloading for Merging Accounts: `__add__`
  - ```
    def __add__(self, other):
    owner = self.owner + other.owner
    start_amount = self.balance + other.balance
    return Account(owner, start_amount)
- Callable Python Objects: `__call__`
  - ```
    def __call__(self):
        print('Start amount: {}'.format(self.amount))
        print('Transactions: ')
        for transaction in self:
            print(transaction)
        print('\nBalance: {}'.format(self.balance))
- Context Manager Support and the `with` statement: `__enter__`, `__exit__`
  - ```
    def __enter__(self):
        print('ENTER WITH: Making backup of transactions for rollback')
        self._copy_transactions = list(self._transactions)
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        print('EXIT WITH:', end=' ')
        if exc_type:
            self._transactions = self._copy_transactions
            print('Rolling back to previous transactions')
            print('Transaction resulted in {} ({})'.format(
                exc_type.__name__, exc_val))
        else:
            print('Transaction OK')

## Probability
> "What is the change of an event happening?

Sample space: the set of all possible events that can happen

probability = possible event can occur / sample space

```
import random
def coin_trial():
heads = 0
for i in range(100):
    # random generates float between 0 and 1
    if random.random() <= 0.5:
        heads +=1
    return heads
def simulate(n):
    trials = []
    for i in range(n):
        trials.append(coin_trial())
    return(sum(trials)/n)
simulate(10)
>>> 5.4
simulate(100)
>>> 4.83
simulate(1000)
>>> 5.055
simulate(1000000)
>>> 4.999781
```

### Data and Distribution
Normal distribution: 
- most important qualities are symmetry and shape
- x-axis: values of events we want to know probability of (ex. values of data)
- y-axis: probability associated with each event, from 0 to 1 (ex. count of each of the data values)
- the high point represents the event with the highest probability of occuring

Central Limit Theorem:
If many estimates are made from trials, the distribution of the estimates will look like normal distribution. The average of many trials means will approach the true mean. 

Three Sigma Rule (empirical rule or 68-95-99):
References the falling distance of observations and the mean. 
> Sigma: standard deviation - average distance an observation in the data set is from the mean

Enables us to know how much data is contained under different intervals. Given normal distribution, 68% of observations will fall between one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two, 99.7% within three. 

Z-score:
> "Given a data point, how many standard deviations is it away from the mean?"

z = (data point - mean) / standard deviation

Z-table: 
Tabulates the cumulative probability of a standard normal distribution up until given z-score
