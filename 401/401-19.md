## Python Regex Tutorial
`import re`

### Ordinary Characters
Performs simple exact matches
```
pattern = r"Cookie"
sequence = "Cookie"
if re.match(pattern, sequence):
  print("Match!"
else: print("Not a match!")
```
`match()` - returns a match object if the text matches the pattern (otherwise returns None)
`r` (in r"Cookie") - raw string literal (stored as they appear)

### Special Characters
Reserved metacharactes that denote something else (not as they appear).

`search()` - scan through given string/sequence, looking for the FIRST location of a match   
`group()` - returns the string matched by the re  
`match.group()` - w/o argument, is still the whole matched text as usual  

`.` - period: matches any character except newline character  
`^` - caret: matches the start of a string    
`[abc]` - matches a or b or c  
`[a-zA-Z0-9]` - matches any letter (a to z|A to Z) or number (0 to 9)  
`\` - backslash: escape character or treated as normal character if there is no special character to escape. Can also be used in front of all the metacharacters to remove special meaning.   
`\w` - mataches any single letter, digit, or underscore  
`\W` - matches any character not part of \w  
`\s` - matches a single whitespace character (space, newline, tab, return)  
`\S` - matches any character not part of \s  
`\d` - matches decimal degit 0-9  
`\D` - matches any character that is not a decimal digit  
`+` after `\d` - used for repetition  
`\b` - matches only the beginning or end of the word  
`*` - checks if the preceding character appears zero or more times, starting from that position  
`?` - checks if the preceding character appears exactly zero or one time, starting from that position  
`{x}` - repeat exactly x number of times  
`{x,}` - repeat at least x times or more  
`{x,y}` - repeat at least x time but no more than y times  

### Example: Check user name and host when validating emails
```
statement = 'Please contact us at: support@datacamp.com'
match = re.search(r'([\w\.-]+)@([\w\.-]+)', statement)
if statement:
  print("Email address:", match.group()) # The whole matched text
  print("Username:", match.group(1)) # The username (group 1)
  print("Host:", match.group(2)) # The host (group 2)
```
Output: 
Email address: support@datacamp.com  
Username: support  
Host: datacamp.com  

Example using brackets:
- allows you to create named groups, which makes code more readable
- syntax: (?P<name>...) -> name = name of the group, (...) = rest of the syntax  
```
statement = 'Please contact us at: support@datacamp.com'
match = re.search(r'(?P<email>(?P<username>[\w\.-]+)@(?P<host>[\w\.-]+))', statement)
if statement:
  print("Email address:", match.group('email'))
  print("Username:", match.group('username'))
  print("Host:", match.group('host'))
```

### Greedy vs Non-Greedy
Greedy match: special character matches as much of the search sequence as possible

```
pattern = "cookie"
sequence = "Cake and cookie"

heading  = r'<h1>TITLE</h1>'
re.match(r'<.*>', heading).group()
```
regex: `<.*>`
match: `<h1>TITLE</h1>`

Non-greedy match - use ? after the qualifier for minimal matches
regex: `<.*?>`
match: `<h1>`

### Functions
`compile(pattern, flags=0)`: turn regex pattern into regex object (for reuse)  
`search(pattern, string, flags=0`: scan through given string, looking for first location of a match  
`match(pattern, string, flags=0`: returns a corresponding match object if zero or more characters at the *beginning* of string match the pattern  
`findall(pattern, string, flags=0`: finds all possible matches in the entire sequence and returns them as a list of strings  
`finditer(string, [position, end_position])`:finds all possible matches in the entire sequence but returns regex match objects as an iterator  
`sub(pattern, repl, string, count=0, flags=0)`: substitutes the leftmost non-overlapping occurences of pattern in string by the replacement  
`subn(pattern, repl, string, count=0`: returns a tuple containing the new string value and the number of replacements that were performed in the statement  
`split(string, [maxsplit=0])`: splits the strings wherever the pattern matches and returns a list  
`start()`: returns the starting index of the match  
`end()`: returns the index where the match ends  
`span()`: returns a tuple containing the start/end positions of the match  

### Compilation Flags
IGNORECASE (I) - Allows case-insensitive matches.    
DOTALL (S) - Allows . to match any character, including newline.    
MULTILINE (M) - Allows start of string (^) and end of string ($) anchor to match newlines as well.   
VERBOSE (X) - Allows you to write whitespace and comments within a regular expression to make it more readable.

High Level File Operations (copying and archiving)

### Copying Files
`copyfile()`: copies the content of the source to the destination. Raises IOError if it doesn't have permission to write to destination file. 
```
import glob
import shutil

print('BEFORE:', glob.glob('shutil_copyfile.*'))

shutil.copyfile('shutil_copyfile.py', 'shutil_copyfile.py.copy')

print('AFTER:', glob.glob('shutil_copyfile.*'))
```
Output: 
```
BEFORE: ['shutil_copyfile.py']
AFTER: ['shutil_copyfile.py', 'shutil_copyfile.py.copy']
```
- special files cannot be copied as new special files with `copyfile()`

`copyfileobj()`: handles arguments that are used to open file handles (vs copyfile() that have filename arguments)
```
import io
import os
import shutil
import sys

class VerboseStringIO(io.StringIO):

    def read(self, n=-1):
        next = io.StringIO.read(self, n)
        print('read({}) got {} bytes'.format(n, len(next)))
        return next


lorem_ipsum = '''Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer
adipiscing elit.  Vestibulum aliquam mollis dolor. Donec
vulputate nunc ut diam. Ut rutrum mi vel sem. Vestibulum
ante ipsum.'''

print('Default:')
input = VerboseStringIO(lorem_ipsum)
output = io.StringIO()
shutil.copyfileobj(input, output)

print()

print('All at once:')
input = VerboseStringIO(lorem_ipsum)
output = io.StringIO()
shutil.copyfileobj(input, output, -1)

print()

print('Blocks of 256:')
input = VerboseStringIO(lorem_ipsum)
output = io.StringIO()
shutil.copyfileobj(input, output, 256)
```
Output:
```
Default:
read(16384) got 166 bytes
read(16384) got 0 bytes

All at once:
read(-1) got 166 bytes
read(-1) got 0 bytes

Blocks of 256:
read(256) got 166 bytes
read(256) got 0 bytes
```

`copy()`: interprets the output name. If the named destination refers to a directory instead of a file, a new file is created in the directory using the base name of the source. Permissions of the file are copied along with the contents. 
```
import glob
import os
import shutil

os.mkdir('example')
print('BEFORE:', glob.glob('example/*'))

shutil.copy('shutil_copy.py', 'example')

print('AFTER :', glob.glob('example/*'))
```
Output:
```
BEFORE: []
AFTER : ['example/shutil_copy.py']
```

`copy2()`: works like copy() but includes the access and modification times in the metadata copied to the new file. 
```
import os
import shutil
import time


def show_file_info(filename):
    stat_info = os.stat(filename)
    print('  Mode    :', oct(stat_info.st_mode))
    print('  Created :', time.ctime(stat_info.st_ctime))
    print('  Accessed:', time.ctime(stat_info.st_atime))
    print('  Modified:', time.ctime(stat_info.st_mtime))


os.mkdir('example')
print('SOURCE:')
show_file_info('shutil_copy2.py')

shutil.copy2('shutil_copy2.py', 'example')

print('DEST:')
show_file_info('example/shutil_copy2.py')
```
Output:
```
SOURCE:
  Mode    : 0o100644
  Created : Wed Dec 28 19:03:12 2016
  Accessed: Wed Dec 28 19:03:49 2016
  Modified: Wed Dec 28 19:03:12 2016
DEST:
  Mode    : 0o100644
  Created : Wed Dec 28 19:03:49 2016
  Accessed: Wed Dec 28 19:03:49 2016
  Modified: Wed Dec 28 19:03:12 2016
```

### Copying File Metadata
`copymode()`: copy the permissions from one file to another
`copystat()`: copy other metadata about the file

### Directory Trees
`copytree()`: copy a directory from one place to another (recurses through the source directory tree, copying files to the destination). The destination directory can't exist in advance.  
`ignore_patterns()`: creates an ignore function to skip copying Python source files  
`verbose_copy()`: prints the names of files as they are copied, then uses copy2() to make the copies.  
`rmtree()`: remove a directory and its contents  
`move()`: move a file or directory from one place to another  

### Finding Files
`which()`: scans a search path looking for a named file (typically used to find an executable program on the shell's search path defined in the environment variable PATH)  

### Archives
`get_archive_formats()`: returns a sequence of names and descriptions for formats supported on the current system.   
`make_archive()`: create a new archive file.  
`get_unpack_formats()`: registry of formats that can be unpacked on the current system  
`unpack_archive(`: extract the archive, passing the archive file name and optionally, the directory where it should be extracted. 

### File System Space
`disk_usage()`: returns a tuple with the total space, the amount currently being used, and the amount remaining free. Values returns are the number of bytes.
