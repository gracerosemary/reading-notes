# Stacks and Queues

## Stacks
Data structure that consists of Nodes. Each node references the next Node in the Stack but not the previous. 

### Common Terminology
Push: Nodes or items that are put into the stack are *pushed*  
Pop: Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are *popped* (exceptions are raised for empty stacks)  
Top: top of the stack  
Peek: View the value of the top Node in the stack (exception raised for empty stacks)  
IsEmpty: returns True when stack is empty (otherwise false)  

FIFO: first in, first out
LIFO: last in, first out

### Stack Visualization
PUSH ----▽ | POP ----△   
[4][Value: "blue" | Next: 3] ---> Top  
[3][Value: "green" | Next: 2]  
[2][Value: "orange" | Next: 1]  
[1][Value: "red" | Next: Null]  
- When something is pushed, it becomes the new top
- When something is popped, you pop the current top and set the next top as top.next

#### Push O(1)
Pushing a node into a stack is always O(1) because it takes the same amount of time no matter have many nodes are in the stack.

Adding a node:
- push it into the stack by assigning it as the new top
- next property is assigned to the original top
```
# push 5 into the stack
# assign 5's next to 4 (the current top)
# re-assign top to the newly added 5

ALOGORITHM push(value)
// INPUT <-- value to add, wrapped in Node internally
// OUTPUT <-- none
   node = new Node(value)
   node.next <-- Top
   top <-- Node
```

#### Pop O(1)
Popping a node off a stack always takes the same amount of time - O(1). 

Popping a node:
- top Node is re-assigned to the Node that lives below and the top Node is returned to the user
- check isEmpty before conducting a pop to ensure that exceptions are not raised
```
# remove 5 from the stack
# create a temp reference that points to the same Node that top points to
# re-assign top to the value that the next property references (to 4)
# clear out the next for current temp reference and then remove 5
# return value of the temp Node that popped off

ALGORITHM pop()
// INPUT <-- No input
// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
// EXCEPTION if stack is empty

   Node temp <-- top
   top <-- top.next
   temp.next <-- null
   return temp.value
```

#### Peek O(1)
- Only inspect the top Node of the stack.
- Check isEmpty to ensure Exception isn't raised.
- No need to re-assign the next property because we want to keep the reference to the next Node in the stack. 
```
ALGORITHM peek()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
// EXCEPTION if stack is empty

   return top.value
```

#### IsEmpty O(1)
```
ALGORITHM isEmpty()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- boolean

return top = NULL
```

## Queue
Follows LIFO and FIFO concepts.

### Common Terminology
Enqueue: Nodes or items that are added to the queue.  
Dequeue: Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.  
Front: This is the front/first Node of the queue.
Rear: This is the rear/last Node of the queue.  
Peek: When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.  
IsEmpty: returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.  

### Queue Visualization
[Enqueue--▽]----------------------------------------------[Dequeue--△]  
[REAR]----------------------------------------------------------[FRONT]  
[4, blue, next=Null] [3, green, Next=4] [2, orange, Next=3] [1, red, Next=2]  

#### Enqueue O(1)
Adding an item to a queue (Node 5)
1. Change the next property of Node 4 to point to the Node we are adding (to Node 5) --> Change rear.next to Node 5
2. Re-assign rear reference to point at Node 5
```
ALGORITHM enqueue(value)
// INPUT <-- value to add to queue (will be wrapped in Node internally)
// OUTPUT <-- none
   node = new Node(value)
   rear.next <-- node
   rear <-- node
```

#### Dequeue O(1)
Remove the front Node of the queue (Node 5)
- check isEmpty to ensure Exception isn't raised
1. Create a temp reference and point to same Node that front it pointing to (Node 1)
2. Re-assign front to the next value that the Node front is referencing (Node 2)
3. Re-assign next property on temp Node to null
```
ALGORITHM dequeue()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of the removed Node
// EXCEPTION if queue is empty

   Node temp <-- front
   front <-- front.next
   temp.next <-- null

   return temp.value
```

#### Peek O(1)
```
ALGORITHM peek()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of the front Node in Queue
// EXCEPTION if Queue is empty

   return front.value
```

#### IsEmpty O(1)
```
ALGORITHM isEmpty()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- boolean

return front = NULL
```
