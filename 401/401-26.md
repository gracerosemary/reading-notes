## Intro to Django

### Object-relational mapper
Define data models with database-access API with the ability to use SQL, if needed.  
Models: source of info about the data. Each model maps to a single db table. 
`django.db.models.Model.`
- each attribute represents a db field

```
from django.db import models

class Person(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
```
- `first_name` and `last_name` are fields, which are specified as a class attribute, and each attribute maps to a db column

```
CREATE TABLE myapp_person (
    "id" serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "first_name" varchar(30) NOT NULL,
    "last_name" varchar(30) NOT NULL
);
```
- `Person` model creates a db table (shown above^)

To use the model, edit the settings file:
```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    #...
    'myapp',
    #...
]
```

### URLs and views
Create a Python model called URLconf, which is like a table of contents for the app. Contains simple mapping between URL patterns and views.

### Templates
Balance between power and ease. Flexible an highly extensible, which allows you to increase the template language, as needed.

### Forms
Can handle rendering forms as HTML, validate user-submitted data and also convert that data to native Python types. Can also provide a way to generate forms from existing models and use forms to create and update data.

### Authentication
Handles user accounts, groups, permissions, cookie-based user sessions. Allows users to create accounts and safely log in/out.

### Admin
Automatic admin interface. Reads metadata in the models to provide production ready interface that can be immediately used to manage content. Has many hooks for customization needs.

### Internationalization
Supports text translation for different languages, locale-specific date formatting, times, numbers, and time zones. 

### Security
Provides protection against clickjacking, cross-site scripting, cross site request forgery, SQL injection, & remote code execution.

## How Django works behind the scenes
Djando is open-source and funded by non-profit DSF, who handles all the logistical pieces of the framework. There are Django Fellows as well as volunteers that manage the techincal side. To get involved, you can attend an annual conference and meet the contributors.

## What is Django?
A python web framework that enables fast web development. It helps write software that is: complete, versatile, secure, scalable, maintanable, and portable. 

It groups the code into separate files:

HTTP Request -> URLS (urls.py) ----(forward request to appropriate view)--> View (views.py) -> HTTP Response (HTML)

View (views.py) <---(read/write data)---> Model (models.py)

Template (filename.html) -> View (views.py)

- URL mappers are stored in urls.py files. The mapper defines a list of mappings between routes, which are specific URL patterns, and corresponding view functions. 
- Views are stored in views.py files. They receive and return HTTP requests (handler). 
- Data models (models.py) are Python objects that define the structure of the stores data.
- Query data using a query API with the associated database (views.py). 

________
Install Django:  
$ python  
$ import django  
$ python -m django --version  

Create a project:  
< from the directory >  
$ django-admin startproject appname  

Change into the outer appname directory:  
$ python manage.py runserver  
(performs system check)
