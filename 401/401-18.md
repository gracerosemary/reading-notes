# Cryptography

## Encryption, decryption, and cracking
Caesar Cipher:
- Alphabet is shifted certain number of places to the left. 
- Caesar always shifted 3 places
```
Plain:    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Cipher:   XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW
```

## Cracking the cipher
3 main techniques: frequency analysis, known plaintext, brute force

### Frequency analysis
Analyze the frequency of characters in the message and identify the most likely "E" and narrow down the possible shift amounts based on that (since "E" is the most popular letter). 

### Known plaintext
If part of the original message is already known, it is easier to crack the rest of the encrypted version. 
Example: greetings normally start the same in a message

### Brute force
Try each possible shift (25) until a sensible result is found. 

## 3 key aspects:
- Encryption: scrambling the data according to a secret key (in this case, the alphabet shift).  
- Decryption: recovering the original data from scrambled data by using the secret key.  
- Code cracking: uncovering the original data without knowing the secret, by using a variety of clever techniques.
