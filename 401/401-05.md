# Linked Lists
Sequence of `Nodes` that are linked with each other. Each `Node` references the next `Node` in the link.

2 types: Singly and Doubly

## Terminology
Linked list: data structure that contains nodes that links to the next node in the list
Singly: refers to number of references the node has. A Singly linked list only has one reference, which points to the `Next` node in a linked list. 
Doubly: two references within the nide. There is a reference to both the `Next` and the `Previous` node. 
Node: individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link. 
Next: Contains reference to the next node. 
Head: First node in a linked list.
Current: node currently being looked at. Traditionally used when traversing through a full linked list.

## Traversal
- Can't use `foreach` or `for` loop when traversing a linked list.
- Use `Next` value in each node to see where the next reference is pointing.
- Best method is to use `while()` loop in order to continually check that the `Next` node in the list is not null (null node throws a NullReferenceException)
- `Current` node allows us to move/traverse forward until end is reached.

## Adding a Node
### Adding node with O(1) efficiency:
1. Set `Current` equal to `Head` (need to start at the beginning of list)
2. Instantiate the new node by adding values as arguments to the `Add()` method. 
3. `newNode.Next` default set to null. Set the property to the same location that the `Head` node is pointing towards. 
4. Reassign where `Head` is pointing. Needs to point at `newNode`.

#### Pseudo Code
```
ALGORITHM Add(newNode)
		// INPUT <-- Node to add 
		// OUTPUT<-- No output

			Current <-- Head
			newNode.Next <-- Head
			Head <-- newNode
			Current <-- Head
```
### Adding a node with O(2) efficiency:
(adding node to middle of the list)
1. `Next` starts at null because it's not attached to list yet
2. Use `AddBefore` or `AddAfter` method
3. Set the new node Next (ex node6.Next) to the next expected node
4. Two nodes will now have the same node Next
5. Adjust the latter node to point to the newly inserted node

#### Pseudo Code
```
ALGORITHM AddBefore(newNode, existingNode)
		// INPUT <-- New Node, Existing Node
		// OUTPUT <-- No Output

			Current <-- Head

			while Current.Next is not equal to NULL
				if Current.Next.Value is equal to existingNode.Value
					newNode.Next <-- existingNode
					Current.Next <-- newNode

				Current <-- Current.Next;		
```

## Print Out Nodes
Use a while loop to check that current != end of list. Right before the while loop starts over, move the current to equal the next node in the list.

## Keep in mind
> When making your Node class, consider requiring a value to be passed in to require that each node has a value.

> When making a Linked List, you may want to require that at least one node gets passed in upon instantiation. This first node is what your Head and Current will point too.

Type: Linear data structure
- sequence with an order to how its constructed and traversed (order matters!)

## Memory Management
- array (static data structure): bytes of memory need to be in one contiguous block (one byte next to another, all together, in one place). 
  - static data structures needs a given size and amount of memory (if more data is needed, a new copy of the data needs to be created with more memory)
- linked lists (dynamic data structure): bytes can be stored anywhere as it does not need to take up a single block of memory (scattered memory!)
  - dynamic data structures can shrink and grow in memory without allocating a set amount of memory
  
## Nodes
> A node only knows about what data it contains, and who its neighbor is.

### Circular Linked List
- End node doesn't point to a null value
- Instead of a head node, it has a tail node where the next node is the beginning of the list
- Easier to add nodes to the end of the list, since you can traverse it at the tail node (first and last element point to one another)
- Can turn singly and doubly linked list into a circular linked list

## Big O
O(1) - constant time
  - Number of elements/input doesn't matter
  - Always takes the same amount of time and memory to run the algorithm
O(n) - linear
  - as input grows, space/time needed grows linearly
  
### Adding Nodes 
- Adding new head -> find head, make new node, point to the current first node of the list, rearrange our head node's pointer to point at new node
  - if we point our head node to the new node before connecting the newly added node, it creates a cyclical structure with only two nodes and all other data is lost
- Adding new last node -> need to traverse through the entire linked list to find it, which takes more time depending on length of list

## Summary
> a linked list is usually efficient when it comes to adding and removing most elements, but can be very slow to search and find a single element.
