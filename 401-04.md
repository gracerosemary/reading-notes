# Class, Objects, Thinking Recursively, and Pytest Fixtures/Coverages
## [Classes and Objects](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Classes_and_Objects)  
Objects -> variables and functions in a single entity, retrieved from classes
Classes -> template to create objects
```
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass() 

# variable "myobjectx" holds an object of the class "MyClass" that contains the variable and the function defined within the class called "MyClass"
```

### Accessing Object Variables
Take the newly created object and add .variable
```
myobjectx = MyClass()
myobjectx.variable
```
Different objects can have the same class, but each object contains independent copies of the variables defined in the class. 
```
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()
myobjecty = MyClass()

myobjecty.variable = "yackity"

# Then print out both values
print(myobjectx.variable)
print(myobjecty.variable)

# output: 
# blah
# yackity
```

### Accessing Object Functions
Take the newly created object and add .function()
```
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()

myobjectx.function()

# output:
# This is a message inside the class.
```

## [Thinking Recursively in Python](https://realpython.com/python-thinking-recursively/)  
> A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions.
Break problems down into small chunks that are easier to solve.
- Functions continue to call itself and repeat behavior until a condition is met and returns a result

Typical Structure: 
- If the current problem is a simple case, solve it.
- If not, divide it into smaller problems and apply the same strategy.

```
houses = ["Eric's house", "Kenny's house", "Kyle's house", "Stan's house"]

# Each function call represents an elf doing his work 
def deliver_presents_recursively(houses):
    # Worker elf doing his work
    if len(houses) == 1:
        house = houses[0]
        print("Delivering presents to", house)

    # Manager elf doing his work
    else:
        mid = len(houses) // 2
        first_half = houses[:mid]
        second_half = houses[mid:]

        # Divides his work among two elves
        deliver_presents_recursively(first_half)
        deliver_presents_recursively(second_half)
```
```
>>> deliver_presents_recursively(houses)
Delivering presents to Eric's house
Delivering presents to Kenny's house
Delivering presents to Kyle's house
Delivering presents to Stan's house
```

### Base case and Recursive case
#### Recursive - decompose the original problem to simpler instances of same problem
```
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3) ⋅⋅⋅⋅ x 3 x 2 x 1
n! = n x (n−1)!
```
#### Base - solved without further subdivision
```
n! = n x (n−1)! 
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2)!
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3)!
⋅
⋅
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3) ⋅⋅⋅⋅ x 3!
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3) ⋅⋅⋅⋅ x 3 x 2!
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3) ⋅⋅⋅⋅ x 3 x 2 x 1!
# 1! is our base case, and it equals 1
```
```
3! = 3 * 2!
2! = 2 * 1!
1! = 1

3! = 3 * 2 * 1
```
Calculating n!:
```
def factorial_recursive(n):
    # Base case: 1! = 1
    if n == 1:
        return 1

    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
    else:
        return n * factorial_recursive(n-1)
```
```
>>> factorial_recursive(5)
120
```

Each recursvice call adds a stack frame to the call stack until we reach the base case. Once base case is reached, the stack begins to unwind as each call returns its results.

#### Maintaining State
> Thread the state through each recursive call so that the current state is part of the current call’s execution context

> Keep the state in global scope

Example: calculate 1 + 2 + 3 ⋅⋅⋅⋅ + 10 
- maintain: current number we are adding & accumulated sum till now
- thread through each recursive call (pass the updated current state to each recursive call as *arguments*)
```
def sum_recursive(current_number, accumulated_sum):
    # Base case
    # Return the final state
    if current_number == 11:
        return accumulated_sum

    # Recursive case
    # Thread the state through the recursive call
    else:
        return sum_recursive(current_number + 1, accumulated_sum + current_number)
```
```
# Pass the initial state
>>> sum_recursive(1, 0)
55
```

#### Recursive Data Structures in Python
- defined in terms if a smaller version of itself (ex. list)
```
# Return a new list that is the result of
# adding element to the head (i.e. front) of input_list
def attach_head(element, input_list):
    return [element] + input_list
```
```
attach_head(1,
# [1, 46, -31, "hello"]
            attach_head(46,
            # [46, -31, "hello"]
                        attach_head(-31,
                        # [-31, "hello"]
                                    attach_head("hello", [])))) 
                                    # ["hello"]
```
```
[1, 46, -31, 'hello']
```
> Starting with an empty list, you can generate any list by recursively applying the attach_head function, and thus the list data structure can be defined recursively as:
       +---- attach_head(element, smaller list)
list = +
       +---- empty list
       
#### Caching results
```
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def fibonacci_recursive(n):
    print("Calculating F", "(", n, ")", sep="", end=", ")

    # Base case
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1

    # Recursive case
    else:
        return fibonacci_recursive(n-1) + fibonacci_recursive(n-2)
```
`lru_cache` is a "decorator" used to cache the results, which avoids recomputation by checking for the value before trying to compute it. Keep in mind that the positional and keyword arguments must be hashable (immutable).

#### Stack Overflow
```
>>> import sys
>>> sys.getrecursionlimit()
3000
```

## [Python testing with Pytest: Fixtures and Coverage](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/python-testing-pytest-fixtures-and-coverage)  
### Fixtures
- Objects that contain data that you want to share across tests. 
- Defined using a combination of `pytest.fixture` decorator, aldong with function definition. 
- Can make calculations and decisions because it's actually a function that doesn't need to be invoked with parenthesis.
```
@pytest.fixture
def simple_file():
   return StringIO('\n'.join(['abc', 'def', 'ghi', 'jkl']))
```
Fixtures can be included in the test's parameter list to be included in a test:
```
def test_reverse_lines(simple_file):
   assert reverse_lines(simple_file) == ['cba\n', 'fed\n',
 ↪'ihg\n', 'lkj\n']
```
Set how often the fixture runs by setting the fixture's *scope*:
(Setting it to 'module' makes it available throughout the tests but will only execute once. Pytest will will until all functions have finished executing before tearing it down.)
```
@pytest.fixture(scope='module')
def simple_file():
   return StringIO('\n'.join(['abc', 'def', 'ghi', 'jkl']))
```

### Coverage
- Checks to see that your test have run all of the code.

#### Using Coverage:
1. Install pytest-cov on PyPL
2. Invoke pytest with `--cov` option 
3. Specify program you want to test and indicate the directory the report should be written (ex. `pytest --cov=mymul .`
4. Turn the coverage report to an output format (ex. `coverage html`)
    - This creates a directory called `htmlcov` which can be opened from index.html file in the directory
    - Web-based report (in red) where program still lacks coverage
