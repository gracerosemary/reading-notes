# Web Scrape
Automatically access and extract large amounts of info - which saves time and effort. 

## Inspect the Website
Right click > Inspect > Arrow icon > Click data file, which will highlight the link in the console

## Python Code
Import libraries:
```
import requests
import urllib.request
import time
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```

Set the URL to the website and access with requests library:
```
url = 'http:asdfasdfa.html'
response = requests.get(url)
```

If access is successful, you should see `<Response [200]>`

Parse HTML with BeautifulSoup:
```
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
```

Use .findAll to locate all the `<a>` tags:
```
soup.findAll('a')
```

Extract the actual desired link:
```
one_a_tag = soup.findAll('a')[38]
link = one_a_tag['href']
```
- code saves the frist text file to the variable link

Provide request.urlretrieve with 2 parameters: file url and filename:
```
download_url = 'http://web.mta.info/developers/'+ link
urllib.request.urlretrieve(download_url,'./'+link[link.find('/turnstile_')+1:])
```

Pause our code for a second so that the website isn't spammed with requests:
```
time.sleep(1)
```

Download the entire set of data files with a for loop:
```
# Import libraries
import requests
import urllib.request
import time
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Set the URL you want to webscrape from
url = 'http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html'

# Connect to the URL
response = requests.get(url)

# Parse HTML and save to BeautifulSoup objectÂ¶
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")

# To download the whole data set, let's do a for loop through all a tags
line_count = 1 #variable to track what line you are on
for one_a_tag in soup.findAll('a'):  #'a' tags are for links
    if line_count >= 36: #code for text files starts at line 36
        link = one_a_tag['href']
        download_url = 'http://web.mta.info/developers/'+ link
        urllib.request.urlretrieve(download_url,'./'+link[link.find('/turnstile_')+1:]) 
        time.sleep(1) #pause the code for a sec
    #add 1 for next line
    line_count +=1
```
